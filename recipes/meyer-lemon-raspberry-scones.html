    <h3>A treat to brighten your morning</h3>
    <p>These scones have lived in my brain since I first made them. They are simple and delicious, bright and tart. I am sure you will enjoy them just as much as I have come to.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4> For the Scones:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 Meyer lemon</li>
        <li>2 Cups(250g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp salt</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp unsalted butter, <em>cold, cut into cubes</em></li>
        <li>1 Cup(238ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 Cup(120g) raspberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Glaze:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup(120g) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Meyer lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <h4>For the Scones:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400ºF(205ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the sugar in a large bowl and add the lemon zest. Using your fingertips, rub the lemon zest into the sugar until it is evenly distributed. Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the cubed butter and, using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it is the texture of coarse sand and there are no pieces of butter larger than the size of a pea remaining.</li>
        <li>Pour the heavy cream and raspberries into the flour mixture and, using a spatula, gently fold until a dough starts to come together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times to bring the dough together. Using floured hands, gently pat the dough into a 7-inch circle and cut into 8 triangles.</li>
        <li>Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown and set. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>For the Glaze:</h4>
    <ol start="6">
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and juice from Meyer lemons and drizzle over scones. Add more powdered sugar or juice if you prefer a thicker or thinner glaze.</li>
    </ol>
