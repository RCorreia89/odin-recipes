# odin-recipes
This project will create a simple website with a few recipes. It will later be updated when learning some CSS skills to make it a little more visually appealling.

This project will demonstrate the html skill I have learned, as well as begin my process of cultivating good git commit messages. This README will be updated when the project is finished with a review of what has been learned.
