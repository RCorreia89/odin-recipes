# odin-recipes
This project will create a simple website with a few recipes. It will later be updated when learning some CSS skills to make it a little more visually appealling.

This project will demonstrate the HTML skills I have learned, as well as begin my process of cultivating good git commit messages. 
Update: Having finished the HTML portion of the site, I feel like I have a good grasp on certain skills. Adding links to images, making ordered and unordered lists, and making meaningful commit messages are all on that list.

This README will be updated when the project is finished with a review of what has been learned.
